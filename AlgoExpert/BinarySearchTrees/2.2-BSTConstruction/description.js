// Write a Binary Search TreeWalker(BST) class. The class should have a 'value' property set to be an integer, as well as "left" and "right" properties, both of which should point to either the None (null) value or to another BST. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property. The BST class hsould support insertion, searching, and removal of values. The removal method should only remove the first instance of the target value.
