Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it. In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding (mirrored) right node. Each Binary Tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right", respectively. Children nodes can eigther be Binary Tree Nodes or the None (null) value.
