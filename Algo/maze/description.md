You are given a 2D array that represents a maze. It can have 2 values - 0 and 1. 1 represents awall in the maze and 0 represents a path. The objective of the maze is to reach the bottom rightcorner, or A[A.length-1][a.length-1]. You start from A[0][0] and you are allowed to go all 4 directions in the maze. Find if a path exists to the bottom right of the maze from A[0][0].

For e.g, 2 paths exist in the following

Sample input:
maze:[[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[1,1,0,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0]]
start:[0,4]

Sample output: true
